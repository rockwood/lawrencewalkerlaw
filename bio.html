                <h3>General Background</h3>
                <p>I have been privileged to practice law in Clermont County, Ohio and neighboring counties for more than 40 years. From 1968 until 1993, I was employed by and later a partner in the law firm of Walker, Bradford &amp; Hill. In the early years, I was associated with my father James W. Walker (1908 – 1980), Raymond Bradford (1904 – 1993), and Ralph A. Hill. My brother William Walker joined the firm a little later. After leaving the firm, Bill enjoyed a long and distinguished career as Judge of the Common Pleas Court of Clermont County. Other attorneys with whom I served over the years included Douglas J. Bradford, Allen L. Burreson (1936 – 2002), D. Vincent Faris, and John Korfhagen. In the years since leaving the partnership, I have engaged in the solo practice of law.</p>
